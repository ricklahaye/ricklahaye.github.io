  <b>[0]</b> <a href="https://securedns.eu">SecureDNS</a> - securedns.eu [<i>2017 - 2020</i>]
<p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  SecureDNS was a public and privacy safe DNS server that used open and proven standards to secure DNS queries. SecureDNS had around 50 million hits a day. At that time there was a need for SecureDNS as such solutions were not yet (widely) available. Right now, Cloudflare and Google provide similar services.<br><br>

  Features:<br>
  - DNS over HTTPS<br>
  - DNS over TLS<br>
  - DNS over QUIC<br>
  - DNSCrypt<br>
  - DNSSEC<br>
  - No Logging<br>
  - Non regulated TLDs like Namecoin and OpenNIC<br>
  - AdBlocker

<p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  A Proof of Concept to detect anomalies in Command and Control Traffic. This could be used to detect Blue Teams, Anti-Virus vendors, and sandbox analyses.<br><br>

  Tools that were used are as following:<br>
  - Elastic Stack<br>
  - Elasticsearch-DSL Python Module<br>
  - NGINX Reverse Proxy for TLS decryption<br>
  - BIND ICS<br>
  - Powershell Empire<br>
  - Cobalt Strike
<p class="subtext">
  <b>[2]</b> <a href="https://ricklahaye.info/projects/cloud.pdf">Automated Forensics for popular Cloud Storage clients </a> - University of Amsterdam [<i>2018</i>]
<p>
  <p class="doublesubtext">
  A Proof of Concept of automated forensics on popular Cloud Storage clients. The implementation used fuzzy hashing to detect clients on filesystems, and then uses multiple tooling including Python to decode forensic artifacts like (deleted) file and folders, records, and personal account details. It supported OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, and Dropbox.<br><br>

  Tools/Techniques that were used are as following:<br>
  - Context Triggered Piecewise Hashes (CTPH)/Fuzzy Hashing<br>
  - SQLite3<br>
  - Python-Registry<br>
  - DPAPI and DPAPI-NG: Decryption Toolkit
<p class="subtext">
  <b>[3]</b> <a href="https://www.os3.nl/_media/2016-2017/courses/rp1/p51_report.pdf">Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Control Systems </a> - University of Amsterdam/Deloitte [<i>2017</i>]
<p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  A Proof of Concept of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is able to detect anomalies in a Industrial Control System (Water Thermostatic Closed Loop Environment) by using Machine Learning.<br><br>

  Machine Learning algorithms used:<br>
  - Novelty and Outlier Detection (One-Class Support Vector Machine)<br>
  - Neural Networks (Long Short Term Memory)
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  <b>[4]</b> <a href="https://ricklahaye.info/projects/ntp.pdf">NTP as a Covert Channel </a> - University of Amsterdam [<i>2017</i>]
<p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  A Proof of Concept of a covert channel using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). This implementation
  was compliant with the NTP RFC resulting in a lower chance of detection, and had significant improvement in performance in comparison with other available solutions.<br><br>
  
  Benchmarks (1 Gbit link):<br>
  - No tunnel: 940 Mbps<br>
  - NTP Tunnel: 920 Mbps unencrypted<br>
  - NTP Tunnel: 360 Mbps AES encrypted<br>
  - Iodine: 100 Mbps<br>
  - Ptunnel: 7 Mbps
