<h1>SUMMARY</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  I’m a Linux Engineer with skills in database administration, system
  administration, application development and leadership. I enjoy connecting people with
  technology solutions that are easy to use, affordable, and sustainable over
  time.  I'm familiar with, and a huge supporter of, the DevOps culture and how
  to make it work with a large team in a fast paced environment.
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  Information security has also been an interest of mine.  As the Chief Security
  Architect for Rackspace, I led a team of senior Windows, Linux and networking
  engineers who were dedicated to increasing security within Rackspace and for
  our customers. We provided critical security advisement to the business as a
  whole and we fueled technical security projects that reduced risk, reduced
  product development cycle time, and increased customer confidence.
</p>
<p class="subtext">
  I was previously working on the OpenStack project and its integration
  with Citrix Xenserver and Nicira's networking stack.  I also maintained our
  high-availability clusters, Debian packaging and various system tools and scripts.
  Our team created a highly automated continuous integration system with Jenkins
  that allowed us to test and deploy new code much more rapidly than before.
